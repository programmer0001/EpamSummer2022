INTRO: G D Em B7 

[VERSE 1]
     Em               D
As a child, you would wait
    C2              B7
and watch from far away.
        Em                     D
But you always knew that you'd be the one
       C2                  B7
that work while they all play.

   Em           D            
In youth, you'd lay, 
 C2                B7
awake at night and scheme
   Em                  D
of all the things that you would change, 
    C2            B7
but it was just a dream.
